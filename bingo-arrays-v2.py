"""
This is attempt #4, which is based on Pandas Dataframes (again)
Typical time to solve 1 million iterations of 146 results: ~35 s
This time, I'm only storing one iteration (instead of all - e.g. 1 million - iterations)
This is quicker than any previous version - more than twice as fast as the previous pandas version (v2)
It also does not get killed when run with 10 million iterations (time taken ~342 s)
